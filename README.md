## log book of the kata 19

1st day

First, I was like OMG it looks like to be the final boss of the maths problem. I REALLY love maths problem, I could send you a math problem I really like if you want.

So, I read like a dozen times kata19. Trying to find hints into the text. 

2nd day; I remember binary search tree, I have seen this 2 years ago. It was pretty nice to solve classification problem. But now, how could I use a binary tree ? I mean I do not know how to order the tree. But I think I have something.
*A few hours later* I should have many leafs to my tree... But the words need to have the same size. So first, I have preprocessed the data from the text file: remove bigger / shorter words. I am using pointer in every function, I do not want to copy an array each time I need to do something on it.
